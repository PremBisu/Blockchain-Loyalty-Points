# **Blockchain Loyalty Points – Aptos Move Smart Contract**

## **Description**

This Move-based smart contract implements a simple **Blockchain Loyalty Points** system on the Aptos blockchain.
Users can **earn points** from any participating business and **redeem points** at any business within the network.
For simplicity, **1 point = 1 micro AptosCoin**, enabling easy interchangeability of rewards across businesses.

---

## **Vision**

The goal is to create a **unified loyalty ecosystem** where customers are not restricted to redeeming rewards at a single business.
Instead, all participating businesses share a **common loyalty token** stored securely on-chain, enabling:

* Increased flexibility for customers.
* Better customer engagement for businesses.
* A transparent, fraud-resistant loyalty system powered by blockchain.

---

## **Future Scope**

* **Multiple Business Balances** – Store separate balances for each business and allow conversion rates between them.
* **Access Control** – Restrict point issuance to verified partner businesses.
* **Event Logging** – Emit events for earning and redeeming points for better tracking.
* **Dynamic Conversion Rates** – Implement variable point-to-currency ratios for different businesses.
* **Mobile/Wallet Integration** – Seamless wallet interface for loyalty point management.
